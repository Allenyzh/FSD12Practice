    <h1>File IO</h1>
    <p>Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You are given a file, say
        <b>EmployeesSalary.txt</b>,
        with the following data:
    </p>
    <code>
    Miller Andrew 65789.87 5<br>
    Green Sheila 75892.56 6<br>
    Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1
    </code>
    <p>
        Each input line consists of an employeeâ€™s last name, first name, current salary,
        and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line, the last name of
        the employee is Miller, the first name is Andrew, the current salary is
        65789.87, and the pay increase is 5%. Write a program that reads data from
        the specified file and stores the output in the file <b>EmployeesUpdatedSalary.txt</b>.
        For each employee, the data must be output in the following form: firstName
        lastName updatedSalary. Format the output of decimal numbers to two
        decimal places.
